Hi!

I am currently developing a parallel project for a Sports bar that I want to
display the live soccer matches results at a Led Sign using a 60"-long led sign with a
Raspberry pi zeroW using python.

As I am creating this in parallel with my work I'm still in the beginning of it, but feel free to
take a look and if it helps you with something, just let me know how you applied!

License:
  If you use it to create a startup or a product AND also became millionaire, I'll be glad to
  receive a contribution in beers! haha

Enjoy!
