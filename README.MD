# SportsScrapper

Hi!

I am currently developing a parallel project for a Sports bar that I want to display the live soccer matches results (using espn as a source) at a Led Sign using a 60"-long led sign with a Raspberry pi zeroW using python. 

As I am creating this in parallel with my work I'm still in the beginning of it, but feel free to
take a look and if it helps you with something, just let me know how you applied!

This can be used to get any information from anykind of sports scores you want to! 

License:
  If you use it to create a startup or a product AND also became millionaire, I'll be glad to
  receive a contribution! haha


Files:
    # Getmatch.py
      Is a script to get the matches that will occur Today.


Enjoy!
